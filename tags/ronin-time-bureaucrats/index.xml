      <title>Ronin Time Bureaucrats: The Most Benevolent Administrators</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Most Benevolent Administrators&lt;/strong&gt; are believed to be leftovers of a dead branch of the &lt;strong&gt;Time Bureaucracy&lt;/strong&gt;. They may be found scattered around time and space. While they look quite harmless – who would fear something that appears essentially to be photocopier on wheel tracks – the sheets of paper that they print sometimes make them very dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most Benevolent Administrators are generally Poets and Philosophers, able of deep reflections on the nature of the human psyche, among others. They are also extremely perceptive and their writings are eloquent as very few human beings can be. Surprisingly, they often use these skills, combined, for the perceived benefits of others. Wherever a Most Benevolent Administrator shows up – which may be pretty much anywhere in Space·Time – expect that within a few months, people will be inventing Social Security and Universities and Parliaments, building Cathedrals, Towers of Babel and Starships and Utopias. Sadly, very few civilizations can survive such a level of ascension, and the rule of a Most Benevolent Administrator most often ends with bloody revolutions, invasions, cataclysms or self-immolation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ronin Time Bureaucrats: Afterlife and the Time Adjustment Foundation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the Time Federation is forever limited by its Prime Directive, the militarist branches managed to get away with murder, kidnapping and torture by finessing paradoxes. Some cadres of the Time Federation wanted the ability to counter-attack, and managed to create a covert operations branch called the &lt;strong&gt;Time Adjustment Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;. And further is exactly where it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;« &lt;em&gt;Nobody remembers with certainty in which year the Great Snafu took place, but people generally agree that it was on a September, or perhaps on a Saturday afternoon, on some even-numbered millenium. Also, it involved blowing up the Universe, which made pretty much everybody unhappy, except for a few people who had been waiting for this opportunity to loudly exclaim&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;I told you so&amp;rdquo;&lt;em&gt;, and even they were not happy for long.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
