<p>The old picture (The Slaughter of the Innocents) one was considered too
violent – while both are museum pieces,
the first one depicts mass murder of children, and was thus discarded

<p>This new version gets rid of almost all violence, and offers much more

<h2 id="interpretations">Interpretations</h2>

<p>Default interpretations:</p>

<ul>
<li>The futility of running away from Destiny?</li>
<li>The burden of knowledge?</li>
</ul>

<p>This picture depicts <strong>Oedipus</strong> and the <strong>Sphinx of Thebes</strong> facing – or
perhaps embracing – each other. In Greek Mythology, Oedipus is the
son of Queen Jocasta and King Laius of Thebes. Before Oedipus&rsquo;
birth, it was prophecized that he would murder his father
and marry his own mother. To avoid the fulfilling of this
prophecy, Oedipus&rsquo; parents had him wounded at birth
and abandoned to die in the wilderness. Of course, Oedipus
survived and was adopted by loving parents – the Queen and
King of Corinth. When, as a young adult, Oedipus eventually learnt of the
prophecy, not knowing that he had been adopted, he fled his
home to, once again, forestall the prophecy.
Oedipus ended up meeting and killing King Laius, his real
father, defeating the Sphinx of Thebes, and, as savior of
Thebes, marrying the recently widowed Queen Jocasta. This
unknowingly incestuous marriage cursed the city of Thebes,
but it is only years later that Queen Jocasta and King Oedipus
realized, after a series of coincidences and revelations, that
they were mother and son. In shame, Jocasta killed herself,
and Oedipus blinded himself, walking the roads as a blind
beggar. Just to make sure that this story couldn&rsquo;t have any
kind of happy ending, their children continued the curse -
life was hard in Ancient Greek Myths.</p>

<p>As for the Sphinx, she was a guardian of sorts, who choked
and ate whoever could not answer her riddles, until she
met a man who could, at which point she killed herself.
In a later version of the story, she actually gave Oedipus
the answer to the riddle, because that was her only way out
this role of evil monster.</p>

<h3 id="the-image">The image</h3>

<p>The fight between a hero and a monster, or a dance
    of seduction, or two arrogant figures, or a woman, more forward
    than what society expects, and a younger man, surprised.
    Also, a desolate landscape, the only entrance to a mysterious
    city. Also, a guardian of secrets, willing to shed her charge.
    Also, a blundering teenager, surprised by a question or a
    secret whispered and about to be trapped into power.
    Also, the clinging hand of a victim not fully dead yet.</p>

<h3 id="the-burden-of-knowledge">The burden of knowledge</h3>

<p>Information, but an information that
    comes with a cost. Maybe the cost is upfront and visible, and the
    heroes will have to meet it to get the information. More
    likely, this information comes with a responsibility that
    the characters should not have wanted, perhaps in the
    form of a choice to make, or a long-ignored debt to own.
    Perhaps it is time for a character to learn of a bastard they
    have sired, or a child thought dead, or a lover or a friend
    or a mentor in hardship. Perhaps it is time for the heroes
    to make a choice where no option is acceptable.</p>

<h3 id="the-futility-of-running-away-from-destiny">The futility of running away from Destiny</h3>

<p>If something was
    hunting down the heroes, or perhaps their antagonists,
    that something has arrived, or at
    least a good reason to believe that it cannot be escaped.
    Perhaps a countdown had started for some doomsday clock?
    Doomsday has arrived while the characters were looking
    away. Maybe a prophecy was under way, or a paradox? In
    either case, it is time to tie the knot. Or maybe it is
    something less scary that cannot be escaped anymore,
    something like love, or a conversation that needs to
    happen now, even in the middle of a dungeon. Or maybe
    it is time for a character to realize their role in the
    story and perhaps even to accept it – a hero may be
    born, or a villain.</p>

<h3 id="example-going-beyond-the-enemy-lines">Example: Going beyond the enemy lines</h3>

<p>World War 2 in Europe. The sarge and his men have been tasked
with a secret mission. They have spent two days half-lost
beyond the enemy lines, and have finally just reached the hill
behind Château Maniais. They only have a few hours before
the Obersturmführer escapes towards Berlin. The sarge looks
at the Château from his goggles. <em>What does he see?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Either side:

<ul>
<li>The entire surroundings of Château Maniais have been turned
into fortifications. Sandbags and barbwires everywhere,
guard towards and machine guns. The only path leads towards
the entrance and it is covered by Panzers. It&rsquo;s going to
be a tough job.</li>
<li>The landscape is desolate, but only one of the windows is alight.
At the window, two shapes seem to be dancing. One of them is
uniformed, clearly the Obersturmführer. The other one is a womanm,
probably his mistress.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The burden of knowledge:

<ul>
<li>The Obersturmführer&rsquo;s retinue is getting ready to leave, that much
is obvious – they are currently cleaning house. Which, among
other things, means that they are taking a bunch of civilians – women,
all of them – to the trench behind the castle, to be executed.
The heroes have a chance to save them, if they act now, but
this might come at the cost of the mission. Or the sarge can
decide to stay mute, to spare the rest of the team from the
responsibility of letting these innocents be murdered.</li>
<li>The Obersturmführer is getting ready to leave alright, and he&rsquo;s not
leaving empty-handed. The sarge witnesses two trucks being loaded
with paintings, gold bars, jewels. Now, some squad members could
decide to go for the gold after – or instead of – their mission.
This could be desertion. Or the sarge might decide not to tell them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The futility of running away from Destiny:

<ul>
<li>The sarge takes one second to focus, then drops the goggles.
The Obersturmführer is right here, not twenty paces from the squad,
relieving himself in front of a tree, or perhaps smoking
a cigarette. Destiny has come for him.</li>
<li>It was only a matter of time before the squad was spotted.
Well, while the sarge was spotting, a sentry noticed something
in the bushes. A patrol is dispatched to the squad&rsquo;s position,
right now.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example-the-shifting-maze">Example: The shifting maze</h3>

<p>A group of random strangers has awakened in a deadly shifting maze,
in which they must band together to survive. Or not. <em>Why were they
put in the labyrinth?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Either side:

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a social experiment, pure and simple.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a rite of passage. If they manage to make it through, well,
some secret will be revealed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The burden of knowledge:

<ul>
<li>One of the strangers knows more than he lets on. He&rsquo;s somehow
responsible for everybody being here, perhaps because he built
the maze, or perhaps because he&rsquo;s the target, and everybody else
was just caught with him.</li>
<li>The maze is an interrogation device. This is not the first time
the strangers awake in the maze. They have died already, and died
again, and been cloned or resurrected. Each time, the maze rearranges
itself, trying to get the strangers to talk and share. This will
continue until one of the strangers finally reveals their secret.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The futility or running away from Destiny:

<ul>
<li>Everybody is sent to the maze, at least once on their lifetime.
They don&rsquo;t remember, because if they survive, their memory is erased.</li>
<li>All these strangers are actually dead. This is some form of purgatory or hell.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example-what-does-the-alchemist-want">Example: What does the Alchemist want?</h3>

<p>The heroes need the expertise of an alchemist to identify the Stone
of Power that they managed to trick away from the Lord of Wind Castle.
As it turns out, there is only one alchemist of renoun in the region,
and she serves in the Temple of the All-seeing. <em>What does she want?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Either side:

<ul>
<li>The Alchemist is busy dealing with arcane knowledge. Maybe, if the
heroes somehow find a way to help her in her investigation, she
might make a little time to look at their babble.</li>
<li>The Alchemist is in the middle of a lover&rsquo;s quarel. Her companion,
the professional hero, wants her tame and housebroken. She will have
none of that, and she has enough arrogance to match that of her
hero. For the moment, neither of the lover is willing to listen
to the heroes, but there may be a way to try and get them to
one-upman each other through piercing the enigma of the Stone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The burden of knowledge:

<ul>
<li>The Alchemist is old, perhaps dying. She knows so many things,
and has nobody to pass that knowledge. At this stage, the Alchemist
wants – needs – an apprentice more than anything in this world.
Everything else is secondary, including answering the questions
of annoying heroes.</li>
<li>Oh, that Alchemist? You mean, your mom? Well, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d like
to hear about your latest adventures. Also, any grandchildren yet?
No? Well, it just happens so that she knows someone your age,
someone you should absolutely meet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The futility of running away from Destiny:

<ul>
<li>The Stone of Power was created by the Alchemist, dozens of years
ago. When she found out what the Stone could do, she did her
best to destroy it or hide it. After all these years, the Stone
is returning to its creator. The Alchemist only wants one thing:
she wants to be far away from the Stone of Power!</li>
<li>The Lord of Wind Castle is the former lover of the Alchemist.
When they broke up, he stole the Stone. The Alchemist wants
only one thing: the Stone itself.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
