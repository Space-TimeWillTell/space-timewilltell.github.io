          <p>So your character needs to find a key, lost somewhere
in the mess left by the previous owner, or perhaps to
pick the lock. Or maybe that piano needs to be moved
into the living room, or you need to find a way through
an opaque bureaucratic process, or to look innocent in front
of a judge, or intimidating in front of a lowly thug.
Or perhaps you&rsquo;re fishing in a river or piloting
your starship or settling a duel with another Musketeer
before the Guards of the Cardinal show up? Or perhaps
your character is an entire religion, attempting to
gain converts in a new land, or a team of medics and
researchers, fighting step by step against an unknown
pandemic?</p>

<p>In <a href="/n-dimensional-tourists">N-Dimensional Tourists ruleset</a>,
all these things are called <strong>Challenges</strong>, and are resolved
with a single rule. This rule
determines whether the characters succeed, fail or give
up, and whether their attempt attracts any kind of Complication.</p>
<p>Meeting a Challenge is something that only player&rsquo;s characters
do. We&rsquo;ll discuss below what happens how to resolve the actions
of non-player character.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll see, meeting a Challenge is a very generic mechanism
which may be used for pretty much any purpose or scale.</p>
<a href="#setting-up-the-challenge-part-1"><h1 id="setting-up-the-challenge-part-1">Setting up the Challenge, part 1</h1></a>
<p>Before you can meet a Challenge, everybody involved needs
to agree on what you&rsquo;re trying to do, exactly. This is called
<em>Setting up</em>. To setup the Challenge, you&rsquo;ll need to answer a
few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Player&rsquo;s decision) <strong>Objective</strong> What is the Challenge you&rsquo;re trying to meet?</li>
<li>(Player&rsquo;s decision) <strong>Means</strong> How are you trying to meet it?</li>
<li>(GM&rsquo;s decision) <strong>Reach</strong> How much effect can the character reasonably achieve?</li>
<li>(GM&rsquo;s decision) <strong>Risk</strong> What kind if risks does this manoeuver entail, even if it succeeds?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is typically a (very short) conversation between player and
GM, to put everybody on the same wavelength. While both the Player
and the GM may have opinions on the matter, the Player has the last
word on some of these questions and the GM on others, as indicated above.</p>
<p>These answers will be used to determine the <a href="#setting-up-the-challenge-part-2">Challenge rank</a>,
the <a href="#setting-up-the-challenge-part-2">Attribute involved</a>, and later
the <a href="#outcome-of-a-challenge">Outcome</a>.</p>
<p>Note that Reach and Risk are on two different scales. It is
entirely possible to achieve a lot during a Challenge (meeting
and <em>possibly exceeding</em> the Reach) while also paying a dire Cost
(meeting and <em>possibly exceeding</em> the Risk).</p>
<a href="#example-chess-match"><h2 id="example-chess-match">Example: Chess match</h2></a>
<p>Tonight, during a reception at the Ambassador&rsquo;s, an impromptu friendly Chess
match has begun between two well-known grandmasters. In front of a high-society
crowd of onlookers, Lady Buckingham, <strong>Chess Grandmistress of the Highest Society</strong>
(PC) and Lord Dervon, <strong>Chess Grandmaster and Heir Apparent to the Prime Minister</strong> (NPC)
will display their skills.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lady Buckingham: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m opening with simple manoeuvers.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Not so fast! What is your objective, here?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lady Buckingham: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to play chess?&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;For fun?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lady Buckingham: &ldquo;No, to win!&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;So your objective is to win. How far are you willing to go for this?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lady Buckingham: &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Well, it is no secret that Lord Dervon wants to sleep with you. If you wish, you could probably use that fact to drop a bomb on him during the conversation, for instance, or strategically show some décolletage, to get him distracted.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lady Buckingham: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not really who I am, is it?&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Your call, entirely.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lady Buckingham: &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll play honestly. On the other hand, you&rsquo;re right that this is a social opportunity, so there will be chatting.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Are you trying anything special while chatting?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lady Buckingham: &ldquo;No, just friendly conversation.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Ok, so what do you think we take this at a leisurly pace? We&rsquo;ll first see how the first few moves go, while you&rsquo;re chatting with Lord Devon, and see how things develop?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lady Buckingham: &ldquo;That sounds good.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Also, the worst you risk during these first few moves is probably looking – or sounding – like a fool.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, we have the following answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objective: Getting a good start on the chess game, while chatting amicably.</li>
<li>Means: Counting on Lady Buckinghams&rsquo; chess skills.</li>
<li>Reach: The position for the rest of the game.</li>
<li>Risk: Looking or sounding like a fool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the GM&rsquo;s decision would have been very different if the two characters hadn&rsquo;t both been
Chess grandmasters.</p>
<p>For instance, if only Lady Buckingham had been a grandmaster:</p>
<ul>
<li>(GM&rsquo;s decision) Reach: As much domination as she whants.</li>
<li>(GM&rsquo;s decision) Risk: Disappointing the crowd.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, if only Lord Devon had been a grandmaster:</p>
<ul>
<li>(GM&rsquo;s decision) Reach: Not being entirely dominated.</li>
<li>(GM&rsquo;s decision) Risk:  ocial shame at being toyed with by a grandmaster.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the rest of this example, we&rsquo;ll keep our original setup.</p>
<p>Also, for this example, we&rsquo;ll assume that Lady Buckingham has already used
all her Sleeve Cards, so she won&rsquo;t be able to use them during this
Challenge.</p>
<a href="#example-escaping-the-furnace"><h2 id="example-escaping-the-furnace">Example: Escaping the Furnace</h2></a>
<p>Alex, <strong>Action Journalist</strong>, had been in the attic for hourse, searching the house of the suspect
for clues, when he realized that a fire had started. He now needs to make an exit, hopefully with
some of the evidence he had managed to sort out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex: &ldquo;So, I had a big heap of documents somewhere in the attic, which I intended to read more
in details. I&rsquo;ll try and make an exit with these documents.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;You have maybe 10kg worth of papers, without any kind of bag to carry them all. That&rsquo;s tricky.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Alex: &ldquo;Ok, then I&rsquo;ll just grab as many as I can put under my arm, and run to the exit.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Alright. That sounds possible. If you succeed well enough, you&rsquo;ll keep an armful of documents.
You might fail, of course, in which case you&rsquo;ll lose some or all of the documents, but the main
risk is not to the documents, it&rsquo;s to you. Because, well, there is a fire in the house.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Alex: &ldquo;Fair enough.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, we have the following answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objective: Leaving the house safely with an armful of documents.</li>
<li>Means: Running to the exit as fast as possible while keeping documents under my arm.</li>
<li>Reach: Alex should be able to reach the exit with the documents.</li>
<li>Risk: Anything that can happen in a fire.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the GM agrees with Alex&rsquo; plan and will resolve it all as one meet. The GM could
have decided that the scene deserve more pacing and that Alex would at first only reach the floor
below the attic. This would have decreased the effect.</p>
<p>Also note that the GM mentions &ldquo;<em>we don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re going to meet on your way down</em>&rdquo; – indeed, that&rsquo;s something that will be decided <em>at the end of the Challenge</em>.</p>
<p>For this example, we&rsquo;ll assume that Alex doesn&rsquo;t have any Sleeve Cards at hand.</p>
<a href="#example-kaiju-attack"><h2 id="example-kaiju-attack">Example: Kaiju attack</h2></a>
<p>We are in Tokyo, today is Wednesday, so a giant monster attacks!
It is called Levinulon, it is taller than the Tokyo General Hospital,
and it is clearly here to destroy as much of the city as it can.
Fortunately, the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force <strong>Mechanized Defenders of the City</strong>
(that&rsquo;s a single PC), in its non-military battle robots, is there to protect the city!</p>
<p><img src="../../images/posts/tourists-conflict-resolution/kaiju.png" alt="Picture by Wikipedia User D J Shin – My Toy Museum – Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0"></p>
<ul>
<li>Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &ldquo;For the moment, we&rsquo;re taking position and trying to distract Levinulon from any civilian crowds.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Ok, how do you do this?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &ldquo;As much as possible, we&rsquo;re using our remote-controntrolled drones, but if it&rsquo;s not sufficient, we&rsquo;re going to make as much noise as possible without endangering civilians. Maybe by throwing cars, or something.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Alright. That sounds possible. For the moment, you&rsquo;re not endangering yourselves overmuch. So, it looks like any risk you take will be something like attracting Levinulon&rsquo;s attention a bit too much, too early, or perhaps destroying a few too many things around you. Also, if you succeed, you&rsquo;ll certainly be fighting Levinulon next.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, we have the following answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objective: Focus Levinulon&rsquo;s attention on anything other than civilians.</li>
<li>Means: Distracting Levinulon with drones or, if necessary, the mechs themselves.</li>
<li>Reach: Affecting Levinulon&rsquo;s focus.</li>
<li>Risk: Little risk to the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force, but some risk to the city itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>This only works because the the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force is
equipped to fight Kaijus. Otherwise, the GM would certainly have
minimized the effect that the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force
may reasonaby achieve (&ldquo;save a few civilians&rdquo;) and/or increased
the risk (&ldquo;get wiped out in the attempt&rdquo;).</p>
<p>For this example, we&rsquo;ll assume that the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force
doesn&rsquo;t have any Sleeve Cards at hand.</p>
<a href="#setting-up-the-challenge-part-2"><h1 id="setting-up-the-challenge-part-2">Setting up the Challenge, part 2</h1></a>
<p>Once everybody agrees on the nature of the Challenge,
two more questions can be answered:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Player&rsquo;s decision) <strong>Attribute</strong> What Attribute are you using for this purpose?</li>
<li>(GM&rsquo;s decision) <strong>Rank</strong> What&rsquo;s the Rank of the Challenge?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Attributes are the 5 Attributes on the character sheet. If you recall, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rock</strong> (stability, authority, power, physical strength);</li>
<li><strong>Paper</strong> (knowledge, deduction, riches);</li>
<li><strong>Blades</strong> (violence, ability to effect change);</li>
<li><strong>Serpent</strong> (speed, survival, stealth, deception);</li>
<li><strong>Unknown</strong> (imagination, intuition, perception).</li>
</ul>
<p>A lower attribute will increase the likelihood that the risks (or worse) will be realized
while attempting to achieve the character&rsquo;s goals, while a higher attribute will decrease
this likelihood.</p>
<p>The Attribute picked must, of course, match the description of what the character is doing.</p>
<p>Ranks are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mythic 9</li>
<li>Legendary 8</li>
<li>Epic 7</li>
<li>Fantastic 6</li>
<li>Superb 5</li>
<li>Great 4</li>
<li>Good 3</li>
<li>Fair 2</li>
<li>Average 1</li>
<li>Mediocre 0</li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely, a higher Rank will increase the likelihood of either failure or that the risks will
be realized, while a lower Rank will decrease it considerably.</p>

<li>Lady Buckingham: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be relying on intelligence and deduction, so that&rsquo;s Paper, which is good, because I have Superb (5) in Paper.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Lord Devon is your peer, so the difficulty will also be Superb (5).&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Alex: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be moving fast, which sounds like Serpent, while keeping the papers safely with me, which sounds like Rock. If it&rsquo;s ok, I&rsquo;ll take the highest, which is my Great (4) Rock.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Sounds reasonable. As for the fire, since you react quickly, it shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult for you, so it&rsquo;s a Good (3) rank.&rdquo;</li>

<p><img src="/images/posts/tourists-overcoming/cardsharps.png" alt="Caravaggio – The Cardsharps - Public Domain – Source: Wikimedia Commons"></p>
<p>Now that everything is setup, the next step is to draw cards.</p>
<a href="#challenge-draws-and-gm-narrates"><h2 id="challenge-draws-and-gm-narrates">Challenge draws and GM narrates</h2></a>
<p>The Challenge draws as many cards as its Rank and places them,
face visible, on the table. Orientation of cards matters. This
is typically done by the GM, but that&rsquo;s not a requirement.</p>
<p>As a special rule, if the Challenge encounters the Excuse while
drawing, drawing stops at the card before the Excuse.</p>
<p>Pay special attention to the cards that are reversed. They will be
used to determine the <strong>Cost</strong> of the Challenge. Similarly, any
card drawn by the Challenge may affect the <strong>Effect</strong>.</p>
<p>Once the Challenge has drawn, whoever drew for these cards gets
to narrate some of the difficulties encountered by the character.</p>

<p>As Lord Devon represents a Superb (5) challenge, the GM draws 5 cards:</p>

underestimate the enemy.</p>

<p>This time, the GM decides to take things mostly literally:</p>
<ul>
<li>GM: &ldquo;By the time you arrive, Levinulon has already destroyed a large subway station
(<em>XI. of Triumph</em>) and is tearing apart a skyscraper (<em>IV. of Triumph</em>). Under
its footstep, you can also see the remains of what must have been a brothel
(<em>A truth, uncovered</em>), full of naked people dead or screaming.
Levinulon simply stepped through it, tearing through as if it had
been paper (<em>Overlooking an obstacle</em>).&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<a href="#character-draws-and-player-narrates"><h2 id="character-draws-and-player-narrates">Character draws and Player narrates</h2></a>
<p>To beat the challenge, the player will now draw cards for their
character. The challenge is beaten if the player draws cards that
beat all the cards of the Challenge. As the player draws cards:</p>
<ul>
<li>the likelihood of beating the Challenge increases;</li>
<li>the <strong>Effect</strong> of beating the Challenge increases;</li>
<li>the <strong>Cost</strong> increases, which may prompt the player to stop drawing;</li>
</ul>
<p>The player may decide to not draw cards. If this happens, all Cost
is avoided, regardless of the number of reversed cards already drawn
by the Challenge. Unless the challenge had a Rank of 0, this means
that the challenge is not beaten. Also, to provide a manner for the
character to bounce back to initiative, the player draws one
Sleeve Card, to be used after this Challenge.</p>
<p>If the player decides to draw, they take cards one by one, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Cost starts below 0, at minus the value of the Attribute involved;</li>
<li>before drawing a card, the player may decide to stop;</li>
<li>if the card is the Excuse, discard it and stop drawing immediately;</li>
<li>if the card is reversed, it increases the Cost;</li>
<li>if the Cost is 5, this is a <strong>Wipe Out</strong>, stop drawing immediately
(you don&rsquo;t want a Wipe Out, ever);</li>
<li>if the table has 1 (respectively 2, 3, 4, 5) cards of the same
figure (e.g. 2 Servants, or 2 Lovers, or 2 Dragons, &hellip;), this
increases the Effect to 1 (respectively 2, 3, 4, 5). This includes
both the cards of the character and those of the Challenge. As
Triumphs have no figure, they do not count towards Effect;</li>
<li>after drawing every card, the player narrates their charater&rsquo;s
effort</li>

<p>That&rsquo;s unlucky for Lady Buckingham, as this card is the strongest in
the entire deck:</p>

<p>As Lady Buckingham simply cannot beat this hand, Lady Buckingham&rsquo;s
player decides to not draw. She has lost this round,
but as she hasn&rsquo;t drawn, there is no Cost for her.</p>

<p>Alex is luckier than Lady Buckingham, as all these cards can be beaten.
So far, two cards are reversed. Since Alex has a Great (4) Rock, that&rsquo;s
a Cost of -2 so far.</p>
<p>Alex starts drawing</p>

<p>This card is reversed, so Cost climbs to -1.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex: &ldquo;Fire quickly spreads everywhere, it&rsquo;s a <em>nightmare</em>!&rdquo;</li>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t beat any of the
cards of the Challenge, so Alex decides to continue drawing.</p>

</figure>


<p>This card is reversed, so the Cost climbs to Mediocre (0). This card is a Paper,
Paper beats Unknown, so the two Unknown cards in the Challenge&rsquo;s hand
are now beaten.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surrounded by <em>paper</em> and rotting timber (<em>Letting the world rot</em>).
This is going to get even worse soon!&rdquo;</li>

<p>Only one more card to beat!</p>

<p>This card is reversed, again, so the Cost climbs to Average (1). So far, it&rsquo;s a
very minor Cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex: &ldquo;At first, I look for an easy way out, a manner of getting out
of there without going through the fire, but no, that&rsquo;s <em>futile</em>.
I&rsquo;ll need to go through the fire to get out of here.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>This card is a Triumph, so it beats all the cards of
the Challenge. At this stage, the Challenge is won.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at all the cards on the table:</p>

<p>So far, there are no pairs, so Alex currently has an Effect of Mediocre (1). Most likely,
that means that he&rsquo;ll only have managed to grab a few documents on the way out.
Alex decides to keep drawing, in order to try and increase his Effect, at the
risk of increasing the Cost.</p>

<p>Once again a Triumph, but still no pairs, it doesn&rsquo;t increase the Effect.
On the upside, the card is upright, so it doesn&rsquo;t increase the Cost,
either.</p>

<li>Alex: &ldquo;Fortunately, as an <strong>Action Journalist</strong>, I&rsquo;m <em>always ready</em> for action.

<p>One more Triumph, but still no pairs, it doesn&rsquo;t increase the Effect.</p>

breathing toxic fumes, I hear a <em>big bang</em> somewhere, but I won&rsquo;t let this distract me.&rdquo;</li>

<p>Levinulon&rsquo;s focus is finally beaten! Cost increases to Fair (2). There are two Soldiers on the table, so the Effect
is currently Fair (2). The GM informs the player that the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force itself is now at some risk.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &ldquo;Finally, in a very risky move, our Pigeon-Class Mech takes flight above
Levinulon (<em>Taking Flight</em>) and Levinulon looks at it. I think we caught its attention!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>As Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force prioritizes saving citizens to its own survival, the player would like
an Effect of Good (3). For this purpose, the player would need a third Soldier. The player draws again.</p>

<p>Cost increases to Good (3), with an Effect still at Fair (2). The GM informs the player that any further reversed card
will start hurting the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &ldquo;Yes, Levinulon looks away from the latest skyscraper
it was destroying (<em>Farewell to the mighty</em>) and finally focuses upon us.&rdquo;</li>

<p>This card alters neither the Cost nor the Effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for the mechs to show their <em>Polyvalence</em>. We&rsquo;re going to try and
surround him, to ensure that he doesn&rsquo;t have a single target, and make as much noise as possible to ensure

<p>That&rsquo;s a second Ruler, so a second pair. This does not influence the Effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &ldquo;Incoming message from the Command Center (<em>Ruler</em>): &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t get so close,
it can destroy you all easily!&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force decides to stop before luck runs out.</p>
<p>So, Tokyo Defense Force has acheived a Fair (2) Effect at a Good (3) Cost.
It could have been worse (the rules are design to make Cost easier to
accumulate than Effect). The player will get a second opportunity to
interpret this result in a moment.</p>
<a href="#outcome-of-a-challenge"><h1 id="outcome-of-a-challenge">Outcome of a Challenge</h1></a>
<p>Now that the cards are drawn, the only thing that remains to do is
to narrate the outcome. Typically, most of what happened during
the Challenge has already been narrated, but now is time to conclude
it as a Success or Failure, and to account for Cost.</p>
<p>As a general rule is that the Player is entirely in charge of
narrating the outcome, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t impact another
player&rsquo;s character – if this happens, you need the agreement
of that other player.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you narrate Effect and
Cost, the GM is in charge of making sure that the description
is roughly proportionate to the Effect and Cost as drawn.</p>
<a href="#determining-and-narrating-failure"><h2 id="determining-and-narrating-failure">Determining and narrating Failure</h2></a>
<p>A character has Failed if at least one card of the Challenge was
not beaten or if the player decided to not draw.</p>
<p>This means, in particular, that a character can simply never fail
a Challenge with a rank of Mediocre (0).</p>
<p>If your character has failed, pick some of the cards on the table
and use them to narrate what has happened. If it sounds interesting,
the GM may ask you to write down your Failure as an Aspect, which may
be used later to elaborate on the consequences of this Failure.</p>

<li>Lady Buckingham: &ldquo;Lord Devon has managed to trick me.

I fell for it. Now, my only way out of his trap is forward. I&rsquo;ll need to

<p>The player writes <strong>Tricked by Lord Devon</strong>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to look at the Reach and Effect to determine just how much
the character has managed to achieve. As a general idea, if the
Effect is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great (5) – The character has achieved the best possible result, regardless
of the Reach established before drawing cards.</li>
<li>Good (4) – The character has exceeded the Reach.</li>
<li>Fair (3) – The character has almost achieved the Reach.</li>
<li>Average (2) – The character has roughly achieved half of their Reach.</li>
<li>Mediocre (1) – It&rsquo;s a nominal success, but frankly, nothing was achieved.</li>
</ul>
<p>The player should now pick a few of the cards (typically,
the pair/triple/&hellip; if there is any) and use it to narrate
the Effect.</p>
<p>Note that Effect and Cost do <em>not</em> cancel out each other,
so you may end up with a Great Effect and an equally
Great Cost for the same Challenge.</p>
<p>Again, if it sounds interesting,
the GM may ask you to write down your Success as an Aspect, which may
be used later to elaborate on the consequences of this Success.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an Average (2) Effect, which means that he&rsquo;s achieved roughly
half of what he was attempting to do. This could mean for instance
that Alex hasn&rsquo;t reached the exit yet, or that Alex has lost roughly
half of the documents, or that Alex has only grabbed a handful of
documents.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex: &ldquo;Ok, that&rsquo;s not ideal, but it&rsquo;s still better than nothing.
So, with my great investigation skills, I had actually managed
to find hundreds and hundreds of documents, which I was in the
process of sorting into boxes. When I realized that the house
was on fire, I started grabbing two boxes, one under each arm,
but when I reached the ladder, I figured that I could couldn&rsquo;t
both get these papers down the ladder and save my skin. I decided
that my skin was more important than my investigation, so
I stuffed what I could in my pockets and ran the rest of the
way to the exit.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Alex has slightly changed the initial description of
his actions now that he knows the result of the cards. As long
as it doesn&rsquo;t change the outcome, this is entirely acceptable.</p>
<ul>

<p>The Reach was to affect Levinulon&rsquo;s focus. Since an Effect
of Fair (2) suggests that the Reach is halfway met, this can
translate to the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force having succeeded,
but not before Levinulon has had the time to kill a large number
of civilians.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &ldquo;For me, <em>Farewell to the Mighty</em> and <em>The rule is the same for all</em>
indicate that Levinulon has destroyed a very important building. Say
the Bank of Japan.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;The Reach was about civilians.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &ldquo;Oh, right. Well, while we
were still trying to attrack Levinulon&rsquo;s attention, it stepped
on the building, before they had time to evacuate. There will
be hundreds of casualties, including the President of the Bank
of Japan.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s in addition to the subway station, the brothel, etc.?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &ldquo;Yeah. Lots of damage.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;You could have done a little less, but it sounds fair. What about
an Aspect?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The player writes down an Aspect <strong>The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force couldn&rsquo;t
save the Bank of Japan.</strong> Undoubtedly, there will be consequences at some
point in the future.</p>

<p>What if the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force had succeeded with a Superb (5) Effect?</p>
<p>Well, in that case, it would immediately have attracted the attention of Levinulon.
Moreover, the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force would certainly have found a way to
neutralize Levinulon as a threat, possibly by managing to lead it out of Tokyo,
or to move the fight underwater.</p>

<p>What if Lady Buckingham had succeeded with a Superb (5) Effect?</p>
<p>Well, in that case, she would have clearly dominated the early game – possibly
with an early checkmate, if the player decided. Also, since such a large
Effect gives the player the ability to considerably exceed the Reach, she
would have managed to further whatever objective she had for this evening.
Perhaps, during the idle chat, she could have managed to slip information
meant to be heard by the right persons, starting the appropriate
high-society rumor, or she could have gotten Lord Devon to accidentally
divulge a secret of interest to her.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you succeeded or failed, it&rsquo;s time to look at the Risk

Challenge. As a general idea, if the Cost is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great (5) – The worst thing that could happen to the characters in the context
has happened, regardless of what Risk was established before drawing the cards.</li>
<li>Good (4) – The cost exceeds the Risk established before drawing

<li>Fair (3) – The cost is not quite as bad as the Risk established before drawing the cards.</li>
<li>Average (2) – The cost is roughly half of the Risk established before drawing the cards.</li>
<li>Mediocre (1) – The cost is minor and temporary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recall that players can decide to stop their draw whenever they want, so Costs
of Good or Great will be extremely rare, and even Costs of Fair will be uncommon.</p>

<p>Lady Buckingham conceded the Challenge without drawing cards, so
she incurs no Cost.</p>

<p>If Lady Buckingham had suffered a Great (5) cost, regardless of winning
or losing, she would somehow have passed for a fool in front of a
crowd of her peers. The player would have narrative control to decide
exactly how this would have happened, and whether Lady Buckingham is
responsible or simply a victim of circumstances.</p>
<p>For instance, people in the crowd could have started gossiping about
her highly improper – and possibly entirely imaginary – flirt with
Lord Sussex, or her pregnancy. Or could have received a
message that a certain Scotland Yard detective was waiting for her
in the antechamber, along with a few bobbies dispatched to arrest
her. Or she could have been drunk and making improper jokes while
playing chess, etc.</p>
<p>Fortunately, none of this happened.</p>

<p>In this case, Alex suffers a Cost of 1, which is barely worth
mentioning.</p>
<p>The player looks at one of the reversed cards</p>

<li>Alex: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting out of this fire alive, but I&rsquo;ll be having nightmares
for nights to come!&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Sounds about fair. Could you write down this as a temporary Aspect
for me?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Alex writes down <strong>Nightmares on Fire</strong>.</p>
<a href="#example-escaping-the-furnace-worst-possible-case-variant"><h3 id="example-escaping-the-furnace-worst-possible-case-variant">Example: Escaping the Furnace (worst possible case variant)</h3></a>
<p>If Alex had suffered a Cost of 5, he would not have died in the furnace,
as his draw was successful. However, he might have collapsed in the street,
poisoned by the toxic fumes, and spent the next two years in an hospital.</p>
<p>Or, he could have made it out of the fire only to be shot by whoever
had started this fire. Or only to receive a phone call from his editor
informing him that he was let go for unspecified reasons. Etc.</p>
<p>Again, the player gets to narrate a worst case scenario.</p>

<p>The Risk was: &ldquo;Little risk to the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force, but some risk to the city itself.&rdquo; –
as mentioned by the GM, with a Good (3) Cost, the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force
actually suffers from this Cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; <em>Unreliable Foundations</em> and <em>Farewell to the Mighty</em>,
so that sounds like buildings collapsing. We&rsquo;ve already covered some of that. There has been
considerable destruction, not just the Bank of Japan. I also see <em>Overlooking an
Obstacle</em> and <em>Diminished</em> – that sounds like one of my drivers was hiding behind one of the
buildings that was destroyed, and didn&rsquo;t get out in time. So one of the mechs is severely
damaged, I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;ll be able to make it for the rest of the event.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Can you write me down an Aspect?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The player writes down <strong>One severely damaged mech</strong>. This will undoubtedly serve later.</p>
<a href="#example-kaiju-attack-worst-possible-case-variant"><h3 id="example-kaiju-attack-worst-possible-case-variant">Example: Kaiju attack (worst possible case variant)</h3></a>
<p>With a Great (5) Cost, the Challenge could have covered a much longer period of time,
with the mechs desperately attempting to attract the attention of Levinulo before he
could destroy too much of Tokyo. Since the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has succeeded,
a large part of Tokyo&rsquo;s population would have had time to escape, though.</p>
<p>Also, much of the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force would have been damaged or destroyed
in the process, rendering the entire force unusable against Levinulon.</p>
<a href="#what-happens-when-a-npc-attempts-to-do-something"><h1 id="what-happens-when-a-npc-attempts-to-do-something">What happens when a NPC attempts to do something?</h1></a>
<p>As you have seen, the rules cover only the case of a PC attempting an action.
This is by design: while it is often fun for players to draw cards, take risks
or play it safe, and see what happens to their characters, the GM is expected
to be impartial and to handle the entire world, which makes notions such as
risks and effects redundant.</p>
<p>Therefore, if a NPC attempts an action on a non-consenting PC, in N-Dimensional
Tourists, this will simply be handled as a PC Challenging the NPC&rsquo;s action.
The rules are identical and the PC is till the one meeting the Challenge.</p>
<p>If a NPC attempts to do something on another NPC, rules are neither particularly
necessary nor particularly interesting. The GM is encouraged to either decide the
results, possibly drawing a card for inspiration, or ask one of the players to
draw a card and decide.</p>
<a href="#tips"><h1 id="tips">Tips</h1></a>
<a href="#sometimes-its-not-a-challenge"><h2 id="sometimes-its-not-a-challenge">Sometimes, it&rsquo;s not a Challenge</h2></a>
<p>Meeting a Challenge in N-Dimensional Tourist is not exactly the same process
as resolving an action in most Role-Playing Games. For one thing, it involves
Risks. Also, high levels of Cost or Effect can have a profound impact on the
story itself. Also, setting up a Conflict, then drawing and interpreting an
unbounded number of cards simply takes more time and effort of imagination
than rolling a die and getting a quick answer. That&rsquo;s probably not something
you want to happen whenever a character is opening a door, climbing stairs or
having lunch.</p>
<p>As a GM, whenever a character is doing something, before setting up a
Challenge, you need to decide whether this action actually deserves a
Challenge. As a general guideline, if the action involves no interesting
reasonable consequences (Risk or Reach), don&rsquo;t make it a Challenge.</p>
<a href="#riskscosts-vs-reacheffect"><h2 id="riskscosts-vs-reacheffect">Risks/Costs vs. Reach/Effect</h2></a>
<p>It is sometimes difficult to differentiate between the Reach and the Risk and
setup a Challenge in such a manner that a high Cost will not contradict a high
Effect. If you encounter such a case, the simplest solution is to assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>if it&rsquo;s within the control of the character, it&rsquo;s a Reach/Effect;</li>
<li>if it&rsquo;s without the control of the character, it&rsquo;s a Risk/Cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, in the example of the Chess Match, Lady Buckingham can, to
some extent, control what happens on the chessboard and in the conversation
between her and Lord Devon, but not what gossip may be circulating in the room.</p>
<p>This is by no means the <em>only</em> way of designing Risk vs. Reach or
Cost vs. Effect, but in our experience, it works when needed.</p>
<a href="#weapons-armors-and-superpowers"><h2 id="weapons-armors-and-superpowers">Weapons, armors and superpowers</h2></a>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tourists-conflict-resolution/party.png" alt="Photo by Wikipedia user William Tung – Cosplay of DC Comics characters at San Diego Comic Con 2015. – Licensed under CC-BY-SA 2.0 – Source: Wikimedia Commons"></p>
<p>In many games, weapons, armors, superpowers and other manners of affecting
the universe have dedicated rules. In N-Dimensional Tourists, they are typically
considered instances of Aspects, either temporary or permanent. As such, they
provide narrative authorization for characters to accomplish things that they would
not have been able to accomplish otherwise, and they can be affected by
Sleeve Cards, but they have no special rules.</p>
<p>For instance, in the Kaiju Attack, the mechs are part of <strong>Mechanized Defenders of the City</strong>.
As such, they authorize the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force to go head-to-head against
Levinulon. They do not otherwise affect the rules.</p>
<p>If some equipment is absolutely central to your character, you may make it a Specialty,
and customize the rule. In effect, this equipment will become part of your character.</p>
<a href="#wounds-traumas-and-social-consequences"><h2 id="wounds-traumas-and-social-consequences">Wounds, Traumas and Social Consequences</h2></a>
<p>Many games have rules to represent the health of a character. In N-Dimensional Tourists,
there are no such rules.</p>
<p>When your character is doing something particularly risky (as established by the Risk)
or takes too many chances while doing it (as established by the Cost), they may be
wounded, or traumatized, or shunned out of polite society, or sentenced to jail,
or any other kind of heavy consequence.</p>
<p>These are all (negative) Aspects. Depending on the gravity of the Aspect, it may be
simple to get rid of it, harder, or even entirely impossible. Differences between
such aspects exists entirely in-story and not covered by the rules.</p>
<a href="#death"><h2 id="death">Death</h2></a>
<p>Just as there are no specific rules for health, there are no rules for Death. While
the threat of Death can make for an interesting story, we feel that Death itself is
generally not interesting enough that it deserves special rules.</p>
<p>If a character has to die because it makes sense in the story, then let it happen.
Perhaps it&rsquo;s because the character was Wiped Out in a Challenge that involved a
clear risk of Death. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because of a heroic sacrifice, or something that
had been decided by the player for some time. In either case, we believe that
Death is nothing that requires special rules.</p>
<p>There are, of course, exceptions. You may be playing in a setting which allows the
game to continue past Death, in which case Death becomes simply part of the story,
possibly a simple Aspect. If you are playing in such a setting, you may want to come
up with rules – or at least agreements – on how to handle Death, Afterlife,
Resurrection, Ghosts, Undead and the like. If so, your agreement will be highly
specific to your setting.</p>
