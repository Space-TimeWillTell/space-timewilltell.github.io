But some Realities have World Laws that simply cannot support armies or invasions or intrigues so complicated that they would deliver a Cosm into the hands of their High Lord. So whenever a High Lord arises in such a Reality, they must, perforce, content themselves with the role of a Reality Scavenger, grabbing bits of Possibilities here and there, perhaps skimming on the side during an Invasion by a stronger Reality Raider.\u003c\/p\u003e",

          <p>*It is a well-known fact of the Infiniverse that each Reality has its potential High Lord, a being who would raise armies and lead invasions, Raiding Reality after Reality to strip them of Possibilities. But some Realities have World Laws that simply cannot support armies or invasions or intrigues so complicated that they would deliver a Cosm into the hands of their High Lord. So whenever a High Lord arises in such a Reality, they must, perforce, content themselves with the role of a Reality Scavenger, grabbing bits of Possibilities here and there, perhaps skimming on the side during an Invasion by a stronger Reality Raider.</p>
<p>But what happens when a Reality Scavenger has been at it for a very, very, very long time? This is the story of the&hellip;*</p>
<a href="#realms-of-the-yellow-chest"><h1 id="realms-of-the-yellow-chest">Realms of the Yellow Chest</h1></a>
<p>(a new Cosm for Torg:Eternity)</p>
<p>By some accounts, the Realms of the Yellow Chest are a dead Reality, and always have been. A visiting Storm Knight would tell you that there are no trees in any of the Realms of the Yellow Chest, no birds, no sun, no human beings. Or, more precisely, that there are trees and birds and sun and human beings, but all of them props, often disproportionate, always made of plastic. But the absence of life does not mean that nothing happens in the Realms of the Yellow Chest. In fact, if you were to look at these props by yourself, you would see them moving, busy, always building something or tearing it down, or having impossible adventures and discoveries. For while those props –– or <strong>Figs</strong>, as they call themselves –– do not eat or drink or breathe, do not grow up or old or have children, they are very much alive by most other criteria.</p>
<p>Figs are, by nature, inventors and builders, explorers and adventurers. The Realms is composed of numerous regions where one
could find skyscrapers or starships, European-styled medieval castles or Asian-styled temples, cavefigs or
pirates or cow-figs, dragons and police cars. While the style of each region is usually specific to a single
theme, that&rsquo;s by no mean a hard rule. In fact, Figs are also highly&hellip; disorganized, to say it mildly. For reasons known only to them, workers will start building houses and skyscrapers in the middle of fields or forests, only to have
a pirate crew smash the buildings to bit a few days later and scavenge the ruins to fix their ship, unless they have changed their
mind and decided to build a spaceship instead, or perhaps a dungeon. While Figs are nominally governed by a President, the
President is essentially a figurehead with little power beyond giving speeches, cutting ribbons and organizing celebrations.
Such is life in the Realms of the Yellow Chest: constantly changing, constantly reinventing itself.</p>
<p>Or, more precisely, such <em>was</em> life in the Realms of the Yellow Chest, until the fateful day, countless centuries ago, where
President Business discovered The Kragle and became Lord Business.</p>
<a href="#life-under-lord-business"><h2 id="life-under-lord-business">Life under Lord Business</h2></a>
<p>Since ascending, Lord Business has been obsessed with permanence, in a Reality built upon impermanence.</p>
<p>Since the ad, the society of the Realms has changed, almost invisibly. Figs are still roaming around, destroying and
rebuilding. But <em>smashing</em> buildings to pieces has become a bit harder, both physically and administratively – the
Realms now have a cross-realm police in charge of arresting Figs who attempt to smash without a permit delivered
by the Octane Corporation. <em>Building</em> has become less inventive, too – attempting to construct anything without
owning the Octane Corporation-issued manual will also get you arrested.</p>
