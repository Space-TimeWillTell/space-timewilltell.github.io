          <p>While we have met Aspects a few times in this manual, so far,
we have mostly contented ourselves with writing them down.
Some are on your character sheet, some have been used to describe
NPCs, or consequences of actions. In this chapter, we will
discuss further what Aspects <em>are</em> and <em>how they maybe used</em>,
both for the benefit of your character and against them.</p>
<a href="#aspects-in-narration"><h1 id="aspects-in-narration">Aspects in Narration</h1></a>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tourists-the-sleeve/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights17.jpg" alt="Sani ol-Molk – Sheherazade and the Sultan (from the One Thousand and One Nights) – Public Domain – Source: Wikimedia Commons"></p>
<a href="#aspect-are-facts"><h2 id="aspect-are-facts">Aspect are Facts</h2></a>
<p>First and foremost, Aspects are Facts. Anything that is written down
as an Aspect is true and undeniable. Aspects are one of the few strict
rules in this game that deal with what may or what may not be narrated.</p>
<p>If a scene has Aspect
<strong>Dark and rainy outside</strong>, then it <em>is</em> dark and rainy outside,
until there is a good in-story reason for this Aspect to become
irrelevant. At some point it, it is likely that the storm will pass
and the sun will rise. Unless your characters are some kind of weather
control mutants or omnipotent deities – and we&rsquo;re going to assume that
they aren&rsquo;t – this Aspect will stick to the
scene, and any event that takes place during that scene.</p>
<p>So, whatever may happen <em>in a different scene</em>, for the moment,
it is dark and rainy outside. One of the consequences of this is
that the Players and the GM alike are <em>forbidden</em> from narrating
anything that contradicts this Fact. If you recall, a Challenge
is a single scene. Consequently, if the current scene has heroes
fighting vampires, and if they need a ray of sun to get rid of
these pesky light-allergic creatures, that is too bad for them,
because this cannot happen for the moment. The vampires might
suffer negative Effects from the Challenge, but the Reach of
the heroes will not, in any manner, offer the ability of exposing
vampires to the sun. Perhaps, after this Challenge, the scene
may be changed and altered, the clouds will split, dawn will
rise and the vampires will suffer from it. But not yet.</p>
<p>Of course, this works both ways: if the heroes are the vampires,
fighting petty vampire hunters, regardless of the Cost of the
Challenge, the GM is forbidden from having the sun rise on
the now heroic bloodsuckers.</p>
<a href="#aspects-are-permissions"><h2 id="aspects-are-permissions">Aspects are Permissions</h2></a>
<p>Just as an Aspect closes some narrative avenues, an Aspect opens
others. Whether PC or NPC, a <strong>Cold-blooded Hitwoman</strong> will, by
definition, know everything there is to know about being an
assassin and have access to all the equipment, money and contacts
that a professional assassin should have. Whenever the character
is involved in a Challenge, this Aspect will let the Player or GM
narrate both successes and failures as those of a professional.</p>
<p>What is true for a <strong>Cold-blooded Hitwoman</strong> is, of course, even
more true whenever superpowers are involved, whether the character
is the <strong>Lord of the Seas</strong>, a <strong>World-class telekinetic</strong>, the
<strong>Youngest Witchmistress of her Generation</strong> or a <strong>Bumbling
Time Traveler</strong>. These Aspects authorize you to narrate actions
that most characters in the setting wouldn&rsquo;t be able to accomplish.</p>
<p>For this reason, in any Challenge, Aspects have considerable impact
on Reach and Risk. As a <strong>Cold-blooded Hitwoman</strong>, you may be able to
snipe the <strong>Modern Necromancer</strong> before he raises an army of the
dead (Reach), but this Aspect won&rsquo;t help you cast a counter-spell
(also Reach). As a <strong>Lord of the Seas</strong>, you may be able to shrug
anything that the whale hunters throw at you (Cost), but you may
suffer considerably if you can&rsquo;t save the oiler ship (also Cost).</p>
<a href="#aspects-and-balance"><h2 id="aspects-and-balance">Aspects and Balance</h2></a>
<p>It would be tempting to assume that Aspects should make draws
easier, but they shouldn&rsquo;t – simply to maintain the game somewhat
balanced and playable despite differences of power scale
between characters.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, a super-hero team with a <strong>Indestructible
Super-strong Flying Warrior Demi-goddess</strong> and a <strong>Skilled archer
with trick arrows</strong>, both of them PCs. Imagine them fighting
side-by-side against an <strong>Alien, Multi-bodied, Civilization-destroying Robot</strong>.</p>
<p>In terms of relative power, yes, the Demi-goddess is impossibly
stronger, and faster, than the Archer. In terms of game, though,
how fun would it for the players if only one could succeed their draws,
simply because of different Aspects?</p>
<p>This is the reason for which, in movies and comics and novels and
stories of all kind that feature characters of different power levels,
each major character has the opportunity to affect the outcome of
a conflict. This is the reason for which, in N-Dimensional Tourists,
the Aspects of the characters do <em>not</em> influence the Rank of Challenges.</p>
<p>Indeed, consider the Challenge of attacking the Robot&rsquo;s near-indestructible
Unobtainium body. The Robot is pretty slow and attacking it is not very
hard – in fact, the Rank of that Challenge is probably only Good (3). The
difficulty, in this case, is not in the attack, but in doing something
meaningful with it. As we have seen above, Aspects may very well influence
the Reach and Cost of a Challenge. So, while the Demi-goddess&rsquo;s Reach allows
her to reasonably <em>Reduce the mobility of the Unobtainium Body even further
by damaging its limbs</em>, the Archer&rsquo;s trick explosive arrows
allow him to reasonably <em>Weaken the ground around the Robot, making it
fall into the sewers, where its mobility will be greatly reduced.</em> If
the Demi-goddess attacks with unarmed combat, she may Risk <em>Being grappled
and immobilized by the Unobtainium Body</em>. The Archer remains afar, so risks
very little for himself, but his strategy could prove <em>Dangerous for the
civilians still in the area</em>.</p>
<p>Thus is Balance narratively maintained.</p>

<p>We have seen that each player starts a session by drawing three Sleeve Cards.
We have also seen that player can receive Sleeve Cards by conceding Challenges.
What we haven&rsquo;t seen yet is how these Sleeve Cards are used.</p>
<a href="#compelling-aspects"><h2 id="compelling-aspects">Compelling Aspects</h2></a>
<p>Consider our <strong>Cold-blooded Hitwoman</strong>. What are the chances that there&rsquo;s
an Interpol Taskforce after her? What are the chances that she already
knows the Di Carpa family, having already executed a contract for them?
Consider our <strong>Dark and rainy outside</strong>
scene. What is the chance that this will lead to a blizzard? Consider
a character suffering from unhealed <strong>Leg Trauma</strong>. What are the chances
that he&rsquo;ll have to stop the chase due to terrible pain? Consider a
doorway, covered with bloody glyphs, through which a <strong>Hypnotic song</strong>
may be heard. What are the chances that one of the heroes will listen
to the song of the siren and cross the threshold? Consider a setting
in which, because of Paradoxes, <strong>Killing Time-Travelers is More Trouble than it is Worth</strong>.
What are the chances that the Robotic Overlords will capture and interrogate
the outmatched heroes, rather than executing them outright?</p>
<p>Just as Aspects enable and forbid stories from taking place, they can be
used to make something happen – or have happened.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick the Aspect you wish to Compel. It can be any Aspect, belonging to
the scene, a PC, a NPC, an object&hellip;</li>
<li>Pick one of your Sleeve Cards. If you are the GM, you&rsquo;re in luck, you
have an unlimited number of Sleeve Cards in the Space·Time Deck in
front of you.</li>
<li>Narrate &ldquo;Since [the Aspect is true], chances are that [something else,
based on both this Aspect and the card you picked, is also true].&rdquo;</li>
<li>This mechanism is called a <strong>Compel</strong>. If you are Compelling yourself,
a NPC, an object, a scene, or if you
are Compelling a PC to make their life easier&hellip; the Sleeve Card goes
into the Space·Time Deck. If you are Compelling a PC to make their
life harder, the Sleeve Card is for that PC.</li>
<li>If the Compel is on a PC, that player may reject the Compel, in which
case you get to keep your Sleeve Card.</li>
</ol>
<p>Compels require no Challenge. Once a Compel has been accepted, it becomes
automatically true, generally a new Aspect if that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>For players, Compels typically serve to alter the story and make their
life easier. This is, often, how a character happens to already know a
place or a story or a NPC. This is also, sometimes, how a group of adventurers
hired to enter a dungeon and look for an artifact, happens to have already
acquired the map of the dungeon – or possibly already beaten it – on their
spare time, hence requiring the GM to adapt and improvise a new objective
for the plot. Or maybe, for a Demi-goddess, this is how you just decide
that a minor supervillain is no match for you, by simply Compelling your
victory in hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>For the GM, Compels serve several objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>they are a good way to introduce NPCs, factions, objects and tie
them to the background of a PC;</li>
<li>they are a good way to introduce new complications in the life of
the heroes;</li>
<li>they are a good way to make a PC do something that the player knows
is stupide, but that makes entire sense in-story (recall that the
player may refuse);</li>
<li>when the heroes are running low on Sleeve Cards, it is a good mechanism
to reload them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note for GMs: as a general guideline, if a player answers your narration
by &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; and then eagerly takes the Sleeve Card offered, your Compel
was probably spot on!</p>
<a href="#aspects-may-be-tricked"><h2 id="aspects-may-be-tricked">Aspects may be Tricked</h2></a>
<p>Oh, by the way, there is another way to use Sleeve Cards and Aspects,
it&rsquo;s called <strong>Tricking</strong>, and it helps you during Challenges, by
letting you cover a card that you have just drawn or that your
opponent has just drawn, with one of the cards up your Sleeve.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick the Aspect you wish to <strong>Trick</strong>. It could be one of your
Aspects, or it could belong to your opponent, to the scene, etc.</li>
<li>Pick one of your Sleeve Cards.</li>
<li>Interpret the card you&rsquo;re covering and narrate it as what you
have just escaped.</li>
<li>Interpret the card you&rsquo;re using and narrate it as what ended
up happening.</li>
<li>Narrate how the Aspect saved you, or helped save you from the
one to the other.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the Challenge draws all cards at once. You may cover any
(or all) of the cards after they have all been drawn. You can only
use each Aspect once per Challenge.</p>
<p>This rule works both for the Players and the GM. However, for this
use, the GM doesn&rsquo;t have an unlimited Sleeve. The size of the Sleeve
depends on the importance of the Challenge. We&rsquo;ll discuss this in the
chapter dedicated to setting up advanced Challenges.</p>
