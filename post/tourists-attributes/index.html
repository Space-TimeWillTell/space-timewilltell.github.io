<p>In N-Dimensional Tourists, each major character is defined by:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>Card</strong>, which is used during improv.</li>
<li>Any number of <strong>Aspects</strong>, which determine what the character can do;</li>
<li>5 <strong>Attributes</strong>, which determine how good a character is at their tasks;</li>
<li>Any number of <strong>Specialties</strong>, which let them use <strong>Attributes</strong> in unusual manners;</li>
<li>At least one <strong>Weakness</strong>, which makes their life more complicated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Minor non-player characters are typically described in even broader
strokes, at least until the story calls upon them to be defined in
more details.</p>

<p>Oh, and one last thing: a character isn&rsquo;t necessarily a human being. It can just
as well be a seven-headed alien, a religion, a mountain, a battlestation
or a conspiracy. As long as it&rsquo;s a <em>major</em> character, the rules are exactly
the same.</p>

<a href="#figure"><h1 id="figure">Figure</h1></a>

<p>A <strong>Figure</strong> is just any card in the Space·Time Deck. Whenever your Figure
is drawn by any player, for any reason, whatever happened is strongly
related to you.</p>

<p>The <a href="/space-time-deck">Space·Time Deck</a> is provided with a number of blank cards designed to
be customized. Do not hesitate to add your character to one of these cards.</p>

<a href="#aspects"><h1 id="aspects">Aspects</h1></a>

<p>You can think of an <strong>Aspect</strong> as of something that would be written on your police record,
or any equivalent in your setting. An Aspect consists in a few words.</p>

<p>By describing your character, Aspects enable you to do things that you would otherwise
not be able to do. For instance, a <em>Boy Magician</em> will be both a Boy (with all
the knowledge that children have, and also forbidden from going into the girl&rsquo;s
dormitories) and a Magician (with the ability to cast spells). By opposition,
a <em>Gender-ambiguous Knight and Plenipotentiary Emissary of His Majesty King Louis XV</em>
will have a very different set of skills, equipment, knowledge, limitations
and certainly objectives.</p>

<p>Just by having this Aspect, the <em>Boy Magician</em> will be able to cast spell
where the <em>Gender-ambiguous Knight and Plenipotentiary Emissary of His Majesty King Louis XV</em> won&rsquo;t. On the other hand, the latter will have the authority to speak in the name of the King, while the former will generally be ignored by adults.</p>

<p>Aspects do not have to be qualities. You can be an <em>Ill-tempered Pirate Princess</em>,
a <em>Lazy Ninja Student</em> or a <em>Good-for-nothing Vampire Dandy</em>.</p>

<p>Note that Aspects are not reserved to characters. Places or Situations commonly have Aspects.</p>

<a href="#weaknesses"><h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2></a>

<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong> are special Aspects. Every character has at least one Weakness.</p>

<p>Being harmed during a Conflict, physically, socially or mentally, will give you additional Weaknesses. Whether these Weaknesses may be eventually cured depends on their gravity.</p>

<p>You could be <em>Physically weak</em>, or <em>On the run from the Queen</em>, or <em>Branded with infamy</em>,
or <em>Obsessed with Justice</em>. You could have a <em>Broken arm</em> or be a <em>PTSD Patient</em> – either
of which might or might not heal, depending on the gravity and your setting&rsquo;s ability
to deal with such trauma.</p>

<a href="#attributes"><h1 id="attributes">Attributes</h1></a>

<p>The <strong>Attributes</strong> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rock</strong> (stability, authority, power, physical strength);</li>
<li><strong>Paper</strong> (knowledge, deduction, riches);</li>
<li><strong>Blades</strong> (violence, ability to effect change);</li>
<li><strong>Serpent</strong> (speed, survival, stealth, deception);</li>
<li><strong>Unknown</strong> (imagination, intuition, perception).</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a Human Being, a Goddess of Olympus, or
a Lemming, you have the same Attributes and their
values range between 1 and 5.</p>

<p>Human Beings, Gods of Olympus and Lemmings are differentiated
by their Aspects, their Specialties and their haircut.</p>

<p>If you wonder how good a Serpent of 3 is, look at the following scale:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mythic (9)</li>
<li>Legendary (8)</li>
<li>Epic (7)</li>
<li>Fantastic (6)</li>
<li>Superb (5)</li>
<li>Great (4)</li>
<li>Good (3)</li>
<li>Fair (2)</li>
<li>Average (1)</li>
<li>Mediocre (0)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, Good for the Lord of Forges is not the same thing as Good
for a lowly rodent, but they can both have a Serpent of 3.</p>

<p>Whenever you&rsquo;re attempting to <strong>Meet a Challenge</strong> in your favor, your
Attributes will increase your chances of succeeding without Cost.</p>

<a href="#specialties"><h1 id="specialties">Specialties</h1></a>

<p>Specialties are where the rules are customized to fit your character.</p>

<p>Each Specialty looks like:</p>

<ul>
<li>*Because I&rsquo;m a <strong>Vampire</strong>, I can perform physical attacks with my gaze, using Rock.*</li>
<li>*Because I&rsquo;m a <strong>Time-Hopping Paradox Freak</strong>, whenever I&rsquo;m stuck, I can often count on my Future Self to have already helped me when I was looking away, without damaging space-time.*</li>
</ul>

<p>Or, more generally,</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Because I am/I have [something pretty unique], whenever [some condition is met], I can [do something out of the ordinary]/[tweak the rules somehow]</em>.</li>
</ul>

<a href="#the-sleeve"><h1 id="the-sleeve">The Sleeve</h1></a>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, you are here to play major characters, not extras. The <strong>Sleeve</strong> is where you put
cards that give you this extra edge, making sure that you&rsquo;re not going to disappear from the story
as easily as an extra.</p>

<p>Beginning characters have a Sleeve of 3 Cards. This means that at the beginning of a gaming session,
they draw 3 cards from the Space·Time Deck.</p>

<p>More experienced characters may have a higher Sleeve.</p>

<a href="#now-what"><h1 id="now-what">Now what?</h1></a>

<p>That&rsquo;s all. We&rsquo;ll see later how to use your Aspects, Attributes/Weaknesses, Specialties and Reserve.</p>
