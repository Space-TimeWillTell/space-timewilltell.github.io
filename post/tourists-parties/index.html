<p>Together, we&rsquo;re stronger. Well-prepared, we&rsquo;re stronger. Well-fed, well-rested, well-equipped, well-informed,
well-trained, that&rsquo;s even better. Well, whenever you group be together, or ensure that you&rsquo;re well-prepared,
well-fed, well-rested, well-equipped, well-informed, well-trained or pretty much anything else, you are
<strong>Creating an Advantage</strong>.</p>

<p><figure><img src="/images/ring.svg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/images/posts/tourists-parties/Danse_macabre_by_Michael_Wolgemut.png" alt="Dance of Death by Michael Wolgemut – Public Domain" class="lazyload"><figcaption class="image-caption">Dance of Death by Michael Wolgemut – Public Domain</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>As most things in N-Dimensional Tourists, Advantages are basically Aspects and may represent
just about anything that makes sense in-story. It could be a strong character providing the
team with <strong>Muscle</strong> during a streetfight, or a <strong>Hand-up for climbing</strong>. It could be an
anime scientist building <strong>Mechs to defeat the alien invasion</strong>, or a super-villain scientist
providing <strong>Green Rocks that absorb Ultraman&rsquo;s power</strong>, etc.</p>

<p>The process is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Declare what Advantage you are creating.</li>
<li>Creating that Advantage is a Challenge, so reach an agreement with the GM on Reach and Risk.</li>
<li>Attempt to Meet the Challenge, using the regular rules.</li>
<li>If you have succeeded, you have created the advantage. Congratulations, the Aspect is created,
write it down on an index card. Depending on your Success Ranks, you may need to adjust the
actual Aspect written down.</li>
<li>If you have Success Ranks, leave the cards that gave you these ranks on the index card. Ignore
orientation.</li>
<li>If you have a Cost, you have also created an Aspect that works against you. Write
it down on an index card. The GM draws as many Sleeve Cards and puts them on the
index card. These Sleeve Cards are meant to be used against you.</li>
</ol>

<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>After realizing that Lady Buckingham didn&rsquo;t do too well against Lord Dervon during the early
match, Lord Robson (PC) has decided to help
Lady Buckingham as best as he can, by attempting to draw the attention of Lord Devon away from
the game. For this purpose, Lord Robson will use his mirror watch to reflect light onto Lord
Dervon&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<ul>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Well, that doesn&rsquo;t look particularly hard, but it&rsquo;s also going to be a minor distraction,
right? I mean, once he realizes what&rsquo;s going on, he can simply ask you politely to stop. Also,
if people realize what you&rsquo;re doing, you&rsquo;re going to look a bit childish.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Robson: &ldquo;Well, people know me as an eccentric, so looking childish won&rsquo;t hurt my reputation
overmuch.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Ok. So the difficulty is Fair (2), let me draw cards for the Challenge.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<li>GM: &ldquo;Well, getting a narrow light straight on your mirror in this crowded room full of statues
and decorations is actually a little bit more complicated than it looks.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><p>GM: &ldquo;Also, did I mention that the room is crowded?&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Robson: &ldquo;As this is sleight of hand, I&rsquo;ll be drawing my Good (3) Serpents. That&rsquo;s already two reversed
cards, which isn&rsquo;t very good for me. Ah, well, let&rsquo;s draw.&rdquo;</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Robson: &ldquo;So, on the upside, I am succeeding, despite all the difficulties, at getting some light in
Lord Dervon&rsquo;s eyes. That&rsquo;s thanks to a mirror representing Hamlet&rsquo;s Ophelia. It might be a little
visible, though.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Robson: &ldquo;&hellip; and help myself to some of this delicious champagne.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Robson: &ldquo;Well, I think I&rsquo;ll stop here. So, while I do manage to get some light into Dervon&rsquo;s eyes,
I have had to move a bit around the room to do so, which attracts a few stares as I elbow and
get elbowed in return. I have decided on my course of action and will not relent, though.
As an Advantage, I&rsquo;ll pick <strong>A little twinkling in the eye</strong>, with Average (1), so one card.
And for a disadvantage, I&rsquo;ll pick <strong>He&rsquo;s a bit rude, isn&rsquo;t he?</strong>, also Average (1), so you
get one card.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>GM: &ldquo;You have two unique cards, which one do you pick?&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Robson: &ldquo;They are equivalent, right?&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>GM: &ldquo;In terms of probabilities, yes, they are.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Robson: &ldquo;Well, say, this one.&rdquo;</p></li>

<p>So Levinulon has destroyed the Bank of Japan, as well as a number of other buildings, before the
Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force managed to attract its attention. By now, however, both the Infantry
(PC) and the Air Force (PC) have managed to deploy. Neither will be able to bear the brunt of the
combat against Levinulon, but that&rsquo;s ok, they are both going to help.</p>

<ul>
<li>Infantry: &ldquo;I think that our main role at this stage will be to evacuate the Civilians, to make
sure that the Mechs can use their weapons without causing collateral damage.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Air Force: &ldquo;Can I wait until I know how the Infantry is doing before deciding whether I&rsquo;m here
to carpet bomb Levinulon or to distract it?&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Sure, so, Infantry, your Reach is to evacuate all Civilians from combat areas in time. What
kind of Risk do you foresee?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Infantry: &ldquo;Well, our forces are spread thin, so we might not succeed at evacuating everyone.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Sure, but that&rsquo;s already covered by the Reach and the Rank of the Challenge. For Risk, I&rsquo;d
say that you need all your vehicles and all your men, and you&rsquo;re pretty sure that you&rsquo;re going
to have casualties in your ranks. Right?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Infantry: &ldquo;How am I going to have casualties?&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Well, if you send your men to evacuate Civilians, this means that they have to evacuate last,
right?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Infantry: &ldquo;Oh, sure.&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Ok, so the combat line isn&rsquo;t moving very fast, but there are lots of Civilians, so the
difficulty will be Good (3).&rdquo;</li>
<li>Infantry: &ldquo;Alright. Can I use my Superb (5) Rock for authority?&rdquo;</li>
<li>GM: &ldquo;Definitely.&rdquo;</li>

the character is supported by the Aspect. The idea is to hand these cards to the Tokyo Mechanized
