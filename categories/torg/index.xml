      <description>&lt;p&gt;*It is a well-known fact of the Infiniverse that each Reality has its potential High Lord, a being who would raise armies and lead invasions, Raiding Reality after Reality to strip them of Possibilities. But some Realities have World Laws that simply cannot support armies or invasions or intrigues so complicated that they would deliver a Cosm into the hands of their High Lord. So whenever a High Lord arises in such a Reality, they must, perforce, content themselves with the role of a Reality Scavenger, grabbing bits of Possibilities here and there, perhaps skimming on the side during an Invasion by a stronger Reality Raider.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
